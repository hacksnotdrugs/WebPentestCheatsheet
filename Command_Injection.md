A number of characters function as command separators, allowing commands to be chained together. The following command separators work on both #Windows and #Linux systems:

-   `&`
-   `&&`
-   `|`
-   `||`

The following command separators work only on #Linux systems:

-   `;`
-   Newline (`0x0a` or `\n`)

On #Linux  systems, you can also use backticks or the dollar character to perform inline execution of an injected command within the original command:

-   `` ` `` injected command `` ` ``
-   `$(` injected command `)`
